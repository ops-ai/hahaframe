This project was built back in 2014 using Service Oriented Architecture, but it was never completed. 
Including it here for reference of that type of architecture, and the vast amount of code needed to achieve a fairly simple application, and the overhead needed to use relational databases.
I might rewrite it using newer technologies soon as a before-and-after example.
